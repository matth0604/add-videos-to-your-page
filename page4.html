      Programming is the core of computer science.<p>

A computer is a machine that can execute a program. With the right program, a computer can do any mechanical computation you can imagine.<p>

A program describes a very precise sequence of steps. Since the computer is just a machine, the program must give the steps in a way that can be executed mechanically. That is, the program can be followed without any thought.<p>

A programming language is a language designed for producing computer programs. A good programming language makes it easy for humans to read and write programs that can be executed by a computer.<p>

Python is a programming language. The programs that we write in the Python language will be the input to the Python interpreter, which is a program that runs on the computer. The Python interpreter reads our programs and executes them by following the rules of the Python language.<p>
      
      The reason we use programming languages versus natural languages is to ensure that what we write is interpreted the same way by the computer every time.  Most words in other languages have several different meanings which would cause errors when the computer tries to interpret them.  i.e biweekly for payroll could pay someone every other week or could be interpreted as twice a week.  We also would have to write out much more verbage to instruct a computer to actually do what we want if we didn't use program languages.<p></div>

         What are Python variables?<p>

By definition, a variable is something that may change often in your program. First, you use variables to refer to various kinds of data such string, integer, list, etc. Then you manipulate this data through variables.  You can assign a variable using an assignment operator (=).  Each variable is referred to as a name called identifier.  The equal sign in Python assigns a value which in math an equal sign is the result of the equation.
        <p>
         Variables are useful because they enable programmers to write flexible programs.

Variables save time when entering code. Instead of entering data directly into a program, a programmer can use variables to represent the data. Then, when the program is executed, the variables are replaced with real data. This makes it possible for the same program to process different sets of data.

Variables are useful when writing programs that deal with big numbers.

The opposite of a variable is a constant. Constants are values that never change. Because of their inflexibility, constants are used less often than variables in programming. <p>
        What is the difference between 2+2 and "2"+"2" is that the sum of 2+2 is 4 but "2"+"2" attaches the two strings together resulting in 22.

          <span style="color: green">Function:</span>  A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output.  They are useful bits of work that have been encapsulated and given a name.<p>

<span style="color: green">What is the difference between making and using a function?</span>

Functions are made by starting a line of code with the keyword def and then giving a function name followed by the function parameters in parentheses. These parameters will eventually be replaced by actual values when the function is used (called).

In the "body" of the function, we write the code that specifies what to do with the input parameters. For example the following code could be the definition of a function called square:<p>
<span class="code">def square(x):
answer = x * x
return answer</span>
<p>
To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses. Like this:<p>
<span class="code">print square(4)
>>>16 </span>
<p>
<span style="color: green">How do functions help programmers avoid repetition?</span> Functions are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've defined a function once, you never have to define it again.
<p>
<span style="color: green">What happens if a function doesn't have a return statement?</span>  The return keyword tells Python exactly what the function should produce as output. If a function doesn't have a return statement, then you'll get behavior like this:<p><span class="code">
def add_two(x):
answer = x + 2

new_number = add_two(7)
print new_number</span></div>
