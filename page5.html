	Abstraction: Helps avoid repetition in code by defining "Classes" of "Objects" with similar properties.  This "Object-Oriented" style of programming also allows us to think about programs in a way that we are familiar with.
<p>
	Classes: A "class" is like a blueprint for a building
<p>
	Instance: Is like an ACTUAL building that was made from the blueprint.
<p>
	Instance Methods:  Are special functions that belong to an "instance" of a "class."  They usually get or set information about the instance they are attached to.
<p>	
	Instance Variable:   A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.
<p>
	Inheritance:  When you use inheritance, you figure out what seemingly different things have in common and then capture that commanailty in a "parent" class.
<p>	
	Method Overriding:  In Python method overriding occours simply defining in the child class a method with the same name of a method in the parent class. When you define a method in the object you make this latter able to satisfy that method call, so the implementations of its ancestors do not come in play.
